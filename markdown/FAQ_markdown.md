## Text formating 

For Italic text use (*) Example: *Italic text* 

For Bold text use (**) Example: **fa** 

or (__) but it's not recomended because of errors with compiling 

For bold italic text use (***). Example: ***oh yeah, baby*** 

Also you can combine those symbols, like this: *Italic text gone* ***bold*** 


## Lists 

For non-numbered lists use (* ,+ ,- ) but only one type for a document for future formating. Example: 

* 
* 

For numbered lists use (1. , 2. ). Example: 

1. 
2. 
3.

![night_city](12.jpg) 

## Links 

For adding a link type this ( [text] (URL)) without spaces 

[google](https://www.google.com/)

## How to work with the remote repository 

1. First thing to do is to **create your account** on GitHub 
2. **fork** someone else's work, you will not do all stuff yourself right? 
3. click that button **Fork** in the top right corner. You aren't blind, don't you? 
4. copy the link of new fork, you need this for telling Git what to do, it's a stupid machine isn't it? 
5. create the folder on your PC and open it with Git 
6. check with ***git status*** that Git is not active in this folder 
7. use command ***git clone*** 'link_of_a_fork(not_a_spoon_keep_attention!)' 

*It will be something like: 'git clone https://github.com/Lexxx42/oh_yeah_baby.git'*

8. open new folder with VSC or use command ***cd*** to switch folder, but it's tricky 
9. alright, now create a new branch with ***git branch*** or ***git checkout -b*** with some cool name of a branch like *beast* or *heavy_metal* everyone now thinks you are based (based on what?) 
10. ***git checkout*** on this branch, if you didn't 
11. now you can go all nuts with and do what you want 
12. remember to ***ctrl+s***, ***git add*** and ***git commit*** new stuff 
13. now the magic begins: use command ***git push*** 
14. you can read, don't you? read instructions from Git and follow them (ok, if Git is a stupid machine, then what about you doing what it tells now?) 

*it will be something like: git push --set-upstream origin your_folder_name* 

15. you did it! pulled a request to merge your work with original. Congratulations! 

16. now go to your GitHub profile and open pull request
